# about 2 FLOPs per element in a realistic GPU-friendly pattern. We prefer this
# pattern here mainly because it gives clean FLOP accounting and resembles the
# kind of floating-point work GPUs are designed to do; Avoid patterns like repeated
# doubling (`x = x + x`), since long self-dependent pointwise chains can trigger
# very poor Inductor compile-time behavior and are also less useful for this

# ============================================================================
# Part 3: Short Writeup
# ============================================================================
# Answer these after you generate `results/roofline.png` and inspect the points.
#
# Q1. Look at the compiled element-wise operations from `1 ops` through `64 ops`.
# Why does performance rise as arithmetic intensity increases even though the
# measured runtime changes only a little?
# A1. The compiled kernels are fused, so the tensor is still read and written
# once at the kernel boundary while each element does more FMA work. Runtime
# stays dominated by roughly the same memory traffic for small-to-medium K, but
# the FLOP count rises with K, so achieved FLOP/s rises.
#
# Q2. In one sample run, `matmul 1024x1024` achieved lower FLOP/s than the
# `128 ops` compiled element-wise operation. Give one or two reasons why that can
# happen on a large GPU like an H100.
# A2. A 1024x1024 GEMM may be too small to fully occupy a large GPU and can pay
# proportionally more scheduling/library overhead. The element-wise kernel has a
# very large vector, simple control flow, and enough independent per-element work
# to expose parallelism even though it is much less sophisticated than GEMM.
#
# Q3. Between `64 ops` and `128 ops`, runtime increases more noticeably than it
# did for smaller operations. What does that suggest about what resource is
# becoming the bottleneck?
# A3. It suggests the kernel is moving away from the memory-bandwidth-limited
# region and becoming limited by arithmetic throughput, instruction issue, or
# register pressure from the longer fused expression.
#
# Q4. Why do the eager `ops-K` points look so different from the compiled ones?
# A4. Eager PyTorch launches separate multiply and add kernels in each loop
# iteration and materializes intermediates in global memory. That repeatedly
# reads and writes the tensor data, so traffic grows with K and the effective
# arithmetic intensity stays low. The compiled version can fuse the loop body,
# keeping intermediates in registers and increasing AI as K grows.
